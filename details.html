    <h1>Kumasi Technical University: All you need to Know!</h1>
    

    <h2>School</h2>
    <p>Formerly known as Kumasi Polytechnic, the Kumasi Technical University is one of the leading Technical Universities in Ghana if not the best. Its name and administration were changed in September 2016 when the government sought to upgrade a number of Polytechnics to technical university status.</p>

    <p>Elsewhere polytechnics are very important. Not in Ghana. Many people don’t respect polytechnic education. Na who cause am! Apparently, just the name change is a step in the right direction. Let’s look into the dynamics and prospects of the new Kumasi Technical University. Let’s dive in.</p>
